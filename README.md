### _Exercise 1 - general_

**a)** Where is the genome stored in prokaryotes and eukaryotes?

- [ ] Inside the nucleus in eukaryotes

- [ ] Outside the cell in prokaryotes

- [ ] Prokaryotes have no genome

- [ ] Inside the nucleolus in prokaryotes

- [ ] In chromatin in eukaryotes

- [ ] Partially in mitochondria in prokaryotes

- [ ] Inside the nucleoid in eukaryotes

**b)** Name two more differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes?

- [ ] Prokaryotes have compartmentation through membrane

- [ ] Eukaryotes are not multi-cellular organisms 

- [ ] Prokaryotes have mitochondria

- [ ] Eukaryotes have no nucleus 

- [ ] Prokaryotes have no ER

- [ ] Eukaryotes are single cell organisms

- [ ] Eukaryotes have no flagellum


**c)** Name examples for an organism for prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

- [ ] Escherichia coli is a prokaryote

- [ ] Amoebas are prokaryotes

- [ ] Fungi are eukaryotes

- [ ] Archaea are eukaryotes

- [ ] Insects are eukaryotes

- [ ] Salmonella is a prokaryote

- [ ] Plasmodium malariae is a prokaryote


**d)** What are the three information-carrying biopolymers?

- [ ] Protein

- [ ] Cellulose

- [ ] DNA

- [ ] Polysaccharides

- [ ] RNA

- [ ] amino acid

- [ ] nucleotide


**e)** What is denoted by the “Central Dogma” of molecular biology?

- [ ] DNA can make RNA and then RNA makes Protein

- [ ] Protein can make Protein

- [ ] DNA can make DNA

- [ ] Protein can make RNA and then RNA makes DNA

- [ ] RNA can make RNA

- [ ] DNA can make RNA and then RNA makes DNA

- [ ] Protein can make DNA


### _Exercise 2 - DNA and RNA_
The genetic information of an organism is stored in the DNA in the form of a code. This code consists of four building blocks or bases (A for adenine, C for cytosine, G for guanine, T for thymine). These bases or nucleotides follow each other in a certain sequence, e.g.:
```
AGTCGTAATTGGCCCCAATTGCAAAAA
```

A single hereditary unit is comprised of a subsequence of DNA (called a gene), which contains the information to build a functional RNA or protein molecule.

**a)** Fill in the following names in the figure below: adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine, uracil, phosphate, deoxyribose, hydrogen bond, backbone, and bases.

**b)** A piece of DNA contains 33% guanine. What are the percentages of adenine, cytosine, and thymine in that piece of DNA?

**c)** What are purines and pyrimidines?

**d)** What are the differences between DNA and RNA?

**e)** In what direction is an RNA sequence written?

**f)** Why is the direction defined by the notation 5’ to 3’ ?

**g)** What is an RNA called that contains “coding” information and what is an RNA called that does not contain such information?
